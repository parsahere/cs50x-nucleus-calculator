#### Description: Nucleus Calculator is a scientific calculator made by basic web frontend technologies, Python (using Python Eel) and an SQLite3 database. It is a complex calculator that uses a parsor and multiple nested and recursive functions to calculate the result of a given expression. It also has a history of the last 10 calculations made by the user, and the entire logs if the user wants to.

## How to use
First, open your Chrome browser. Python Eel uses a Chrome instance for every app, to allow connections between the frontend and the backend.

Then simply, execute the following in your terminal:
```bash
python Nucleus.py
# or
python3 Nucleus.py
```

From here, you can use the calculator easily. Note that the calculator is tested, and does return actually accurate results.

Please also note that if you close the window, the application will be _permanently stopped_ and you will need to **re-execute the start command** above.

### Developer's note
I, Parsa Sabet, have created and designed the Nucleus Calculator.
The entire codebase is written by myself, with little help to complete the parser from the internet. No AI was used in the creation process or testing of this basic application, and no other individuals or groups have helped me complete it directly.
I have searched through the internet with the problems that I've had but no blocks of the code were shared and no help was asked for.
Thank you for respecting the license of this application, and using this calculator.
