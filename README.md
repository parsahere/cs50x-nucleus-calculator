#### Description:
Nucleus Calculator is a scientific calculator made by basic web frontend technologies (HTML, CSS and Javascript), Python (using the Python Eel library) and an SQLite3 database for logging the expressions user enters for results. It is a complex calculator that uses a parser and multiple nested and recursive functions developed in python to calculate the result of a given expression, without relying on any built-in functions of either of Javascript or Python languages. It also has a log history of the last 10 calculations made by the user, and the recent 100 logs in the settings section if the user wants to. The reason why a library such as flask was not used is because, Python Eel can be easily used to create an indivisual and independant executable file that once opened like an application or built by the tools for this task, can be used like a desktop app.

## How to use
First, open your Chrome browser. Python Eel uses a Chrome instance for every app, to allow connections between the frontend and the backend.

Then simply, execute the following in your terminal:
```bash
python Nucleus.py
# or
python3 Nucleus.py
```

From here, you can use the calculator easily. Note that the calculator is tested, and does return actually accurate results.

Please also note that if you close the window, the application will be _permanently stopped_ and you will need to **re-execute the start command** above.

### Developer's note
I, Parsa Sabet, have created and designed the Nucleus Calculator.
The entire codebase is written by myself, with little help to complete the parser from the internet. No AI was used in the creation process or testing of this basic application, and no other individuals or groups have helped me complete it directly.
I have searched through the internet with the problems that I've had but no blocks of the code were shared and no help was asked for.
Thank you for respecting the license of this application, and using this calculator.
